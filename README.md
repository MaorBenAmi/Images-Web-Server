## Images Web Server

1. npm install
2. npm run build
3. npm run start
4. npm run test

## Assumptions:

1. All images are in the same size or we will create a image croppoer for fitting the image to the div size for saving the aspect ratio of the image.
2. Server side is giving the images in pagination (for the infinite loader), as for now it is implemented at the cient side.

## Things to improve:

1. Infinite scroller is not good - for some reason its get stuck on the second page.
2. Responsive grid - because i havn't used any library for the UI, it is responsive but i don't think in the way you want it.
3. Probrarly I will changed the description area.
